    description: For Open science to be possible, scientific outputs - the data, software, publications, etc - must be FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Re-usable). Achieving this is a multi-personality challenge, as it involves the scientists producing scientific outputs; labs, institutes, universities, marine stations, and research infrastructures providing the support to produce the science; online data publishers providing archiving, standardising, and discovery services; scientific journals and the encouraging of open access publishing. It is also a multi-technology challenge, involving; database technology and services, federated and linked open data, ontologies and semantic annotation, metadata standards and formats, e-tools to FAIRify the scientific outputs, interoperability across scientific and data domains, and the ability to deal with an ever-evolving landscape.
