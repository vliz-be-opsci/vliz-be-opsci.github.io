# Open Science 

### Open Science principles
Open science is a set of principles and practices that aim to make scientific research accessible to everyone. This benefits not only the scientific community, but also society as a whole. Science is part of almost everything that happens in our modern world, and at VLIZ we aim to contribute towards the increased understanding of, use of, and trust in science by society.  

Open Science@VLIZ is about  
- *Open Access* to the scientific outputs we create: data, publications, software
- *Open Source* for the software we create: so that others can adopt and adapt 
- *Open Initiatives*: being open to collaborations
- *Open Understanding*: reaching out to multilingual audiences, inside *and* outside the scientific domain
- *Open Infrastructure*: developing system architecture that is open access and open source

Open science is also about embracing principles of accessibility, transparency, inclusivity, and sustainability. We fully support the [UNESCO recommendations on Open Science](https://www.unesco.org/en/open-science/about). 

### Ambitions
At VLIZ we believe that embracing Open Science will increase the quality, efficiency, and impact of science. We have already taken important steps in the fields of Open Access and Open Data. Unfortunately Open Science practices are not yet the norm, and at VLIZ we aim to use the expertise we have built up within the Data Centre and the Library to help smooth the way to the adoption of Open Sciences practices and technologies in the domain of Marine Science. We participate in numerous regional and EU projects that aim to make Science more Open, and crucially that actually help embed the practices of Open Science in a practical, workable way with the scientists and organisations that create the science. 

By showcasing what we do at VLIZ with our data, data portals, and tools, we aim to raise awarness of the importance, value, and practices of open science. In our system architecture we embrace the concepts of universality, federated searches, distribution through uniformisation, replacing duplicating with linking and harvesting with indexing, proper tuning and adoption of transparent proxying and caching, leveraging the principle of permissionless innovation, etc. Rather than just working “on the web”, our system architectures will need to become nodes and components, fully submerged “in the web”.  


### The components (~ how it tries to achieve this)
