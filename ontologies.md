# Ontologies & Vocabularies <a name="ontologies"></a>

Ontologies and vocabularies support linked data generation by providing standardized concepts and relationships, enabling data from different sources to be linked and integrated seamlessly. This ensures better interoperability and data sharing across systems, enhancing discoverability and analysis.

Some of the ontologies and vocabularies we currently maintain include:

## Vocab server <a name="vocab"></a>

Available at: https://vocab.vliz.be/

The vocab server is a tool which allows users to search and integrate controlled vocabulary terms into applications, particularly in the marine research domain. This system helps ensure accurate linking of data concepts without requiring technical expertise in linked data or RDF formats. It is part of the broader effort to support open science and data management in marine research.
