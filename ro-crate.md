RO-CRATE Demo Page
==================

#### Our affinity to RO-Crate spec and community

Our affinity to the RO-Crate spec and community stems from our commitment to open science and the FAIR principles. The RO-Crate (Research Object Crate) is a community-driven specification for packaging and exchanging research data and associated metadata. It provides a structured way to describe and organize research data, making it easier to share, discover, and reproduce scientific findings.

#### Our GitHub connection approach

To facilitate quick and open sharing of data, we have implemented a GitHub connection approach using webwidgets to help visualize RO-Crate content. This approach allows us to leverage the collaborative features and version control capabilities of GitHub while providing a user-friendly interface for exploring and interacting with RO-Crate data.

#### Introduction GitHub Actions

We have introduced GitHub Actions to automate various tasks related to RO-Crate. GitHub Actions is a powerful workflow automation tool provided by GitHub. It allows us to define custom workflows that can be triggered by events, such as pushing changes to a repository. We have created several GitHub Actions to generate HTML sites from different types of repositories:

*   [rocrate-to-pages](https://github.com/vliz-be-opsci/rocrate-to-pages){:target=”_blank”}: This Action generates a GitHub Pages site from a repository containing a RO-Crate.
*   [profile-repository-to-pages](https://github.com/vliz-be-opsci/profile-repository-to-pages){:target=”_blank”}: This Action generates an HTML site for a collection of profiles.
*   [space-to-pages](https://github.com/vliz-be-opsci/space-to-pages){:target=”_blank”}: This Action generates a website for a project.

#### Link to the demo pages

You can explore the following demo pages to see the GitHub Actions in action:

*   [RO-Crate Demo](https://open-science.vliz.be/demo-rocrate/){:target=”_blank”}: This page showcases the RO-Crate preview index generated using the rocrate-to-pages Action.
*   [Profile Repository Demo](https://open-science.vliz.be/demo-profile-repository/){:target=”_blank”}: This page demonstrates the Test Profile registry generated using the profile-repository-to-pages Action.
*   [Space Demo](https://open-science.vliz.be/demo-space-to-pages/){:target=”_blank”}: This page showcases the website for a project generated using the space-to-pages Action.

You can explore these demo pages to get a better understanding of how RO-Crate can be utilized and visualized using our GitHub connection approach and GitHub Actions.
