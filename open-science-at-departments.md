# Departments

TODO 
This page is to contain information on the departements that are involved
What open science is to them / how they're benefitting from open science / ... in the form of a statement


## Research <a name="research"></a>

Open science, including open data, is essential for research. The big challenges we face today - such as climate change and biodiversity loss - require a collective effort from groups around the globe involved in data gathering, data processing, data analysis, data interpretation and science communication. Without open and transparent science behind all these efforts, international, cross discipline and verifiable research would not be possible and the strong international research network would seize to exist. 


Today, many publishers and funding bodies demand open science principles to apply, e.g., by requesting to adopt FAIR (Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reuse), principles to data and scripts used in publications. What we see from this development is that through open science, research output is not hampered but instead becomes much more impactful and applicable. This is a development that we strongly welcome in the research department and that remains essential for our pathway towards the climate biodiversity nexus.


## Data Centre <a name="vmdc"></a>

For the data center a focus on "open science" is a natural one to take. Our supporting role "to manage, cleanup, standardize and share data" within the organisation has lead to a built up expertise in its own right by itself which logically extends towards stewardship, guidance and the introduction of new and better techniques in the organization.  

The shear growth of data volumes and the inceasing demands on their prompt (and qualitiative) availability is further pushing us towards automation and standardisation. This matches totally with the focus on «interoperability» coming from the movement towards [FAIR and linked-open-data](/fair-open-data).

Engaging in a fruitful collaboration between data science and data engineering is a growing part of that.
