# Knowledge Graph Analysis Platform

## Background

Early in our semantic web approach to open science data management we identified the need to support end-users in discovering linked-data and navigating through the knowledge graph.

We do this by providing a series of tools that allow users to explore and analyze knowledge graphs in a user-friendly and intuitive way. These tool make abstractions of the underlying RDF data and provide a more familiar tabular view of the data.

The Knowledge Graph Analysis Platform contains a suite of tools namely:

- **yasgui**: A sparql query editor and visualizer that allows users to query the knowledge graph and visualize the results.
- **graphdb**: An RDF graph database that will gather and store the knowledge graph data.
- **sembench**: A semantic web workbench that allows users to ingest, travers/harvest and query the knowledge graph.

The sembench itself also contains a jupyter notebook that allows users to interact with the knowledge graph in a more familiar python environment.

## What does it do

TODO: Some architecture diagram here

## Where can I find it?

The Knowledge Graph Analysis Platform is available as a collection of open-source tools that are being developed by the VLIZ Open Science team. The tools are available on GitHub and can be installed and run locally.

The tools are being developed in Python and are being shared
