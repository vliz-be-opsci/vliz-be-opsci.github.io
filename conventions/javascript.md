## Conventions relating to _Javascript Projects_

### How to Create a JavaScript Project

1. **Project Initialization**: To start a new JavaScript project, create a project directory and navigate to it in your terminal.

2. **Initialize a Git Repository** (Optional): If you're using Git, run the following commands to initialize a Git repository:

   ```bash
   git init
   ```

3. **Initialize a Node.js Project**: To create a Node.js project, you can use the following commands:

   ```bash
   mkdir my-javascript-project
   cd my-javascript-project
   npm init -y
   ```

4. **Code Editor**: Open your favorite code editor to start working on your project.

### Dependency Management with npm

[NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) is the most widely used package manager for JavaScript. To manage your project's dependencies:

1. **Install Dependencies**: Use the `npm install` command to install packages. For example:

   ```bash
   npm install package-name
   ```

2. **package.json**: Your project's dependencies and other metadata are stored in `package.json`. Make sure to keep it updated.

3. **Scripts**: You can define custom scripts in `package.json` to automate common tasks like building, testing, and running your project.

### Linting and Testing

#### Linting Rules

Enforcing linting rules is essential for maintaining code quality. You can use tools like [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for JavaScript. Here's how to set it up:

1. **Install ESLint**: Run the following command to install ESLint:

   ```bash
   npm install eslint --save-dev
   ```

2. **ESLint Configuration**: Create an ESLint configuration file (`.eslintrc.js`) and customize linting rules to your project's needs.

#### Unit Testing

For unit testing, [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) is one of the most popular testing frameworks for JavaScript. To set up Jest:

1. **Install Jest**: Run the following command to install Jest:

   ```bash
   npm install jest --save-dev
   ```

2. **Jest Configuration**: Create a Jest configuration file (e.g., `jest.config.js`) and configure it according to your project's requirements.

### Project Templates

Consider using project templating tools like [Cookiecutter](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/) for JavaScript to streamline project creation. Alternatively, you can create your own custom project template that includes all the necessary configurations and boilerplate code.

### How to Document Your Code

Proper code documentation is crucial for understanding and maintaining your project. Consider using tools like JSDoc for documenting JavaScript code.
