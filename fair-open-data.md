## Vision <a name="vision"></a>

![Fair Data Principles](/assets/media/img/content/FAIR_data_principles.jpg){:class="image-style-content-embed"}  A focal point in our strategy on open science is making research data FAIR and open.  And as we like to believe: interlinked. \
\
The [FAIR principles](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/) outlined in [Wilkinson et al.](https://doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2016.18){:target=”_blank”} guide the enterprise of research data management towards making data: **F**indable, **A**ccessible, **I**nteroperable and **R**eusable.


![5star open data](assets/media/img/content/5-star_deployment_scheme_for_Open_Data.png){:.image-style-content-embed target=”_blank”} In a broader scope (i.e. outside the more strict research domain) there are the additional [principles of linked-open-data](https://www.w3.org/wiki/LinkedData){:target=”_blank”} and the semantic web to consider. \
\
We very much see these as going hand in hand: the one set of guidelines naturally extends and completes the other; and the ubiquitous web-stack provides the methodology, the technology, and the practical platform for reliable and interoperable information exchange on a global scale.


> ##### There is no separate web for research and science.
> The daring goal for #openscience is to let to let quality research data play its educational role by entering the same arena now populated by lolcatz, fake news, and antivax-conspiracies.

In conclusion, these guiding principles urge research data management to take an outside ignorant view on the data they are intimately familiar with. The challenge is to *assess and expose*, and not to assume that end users have the inside knowledge of domain experts or have the familiar use-cases.  The goal is to make sure that the information content of the data becomes more and more readily readable to these new audiences:
1. research experts from different domains
2. stakeholders from outside research: citizen-scientist, policy makers, and the general public
3. automated processes in an emerging field of computer-assisted research

Packaged in a compelling story, we motivate the above goals in the so called «Felicity Jones effect»

## Technical Approach <a name="technical"></a>

To achieve that vision we have selected a number of objectives to focus on:

* apply [RDF](https://www.w3.org/RDF/){:target=”_blank”} to expose the data we have as linked-open-data publications  
* provide harvestable change-feeds on our data catalogues using standards such as [OAI-PMH](https://www.openarchives.org/pmh/) and [LDES](https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/){:target=”_blank”}
* apply [RO-Crate](https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/){:target=”_blank”} 
* provide multilingual support to reference vocabularies
* promote an open (platform-neutral) web-intergration approach through proper [REST APIs](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm){:target=”_blank”} and open [WebComponents](https://www.w3.org/TR/components-intro/){:target=”_blank”}
* provide traceable provenance data following the [EOSC-LIFE Common Provenance Model](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4705074){:target=”_blank”}


## Practical Examples <a name="examples"></a>

The above is shown in practice in our [available linked-data publications](/linked-data) as well as in the many [applications and tools](/applications-tools)  or [software packages](/applications-tools/software-packages) we provide.
