# Open Science @ VLIZ

### Our goals

List of particular goals we have - the main ones at least. e.g. to published our DBs as LOD, to have LOD change feeds as a normal, to have faceted searches (or whatever) as a norm, to accommodate dutch and english (others?), to have semantics embedded....probably need to discuss these as a groupd

### Open Science in practice 

List of the things we have done, and list of the things we are working on
First would include: MR, urm...?
Second: maregraph and LOD, github publishing (whatever we will call dmbon), rocrate, provenance profiles, semantic server, ...

As we complete things, move them in this list. Probably also need to go over this list together.
