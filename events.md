    - title: FAIR-EASE Second Annual Event
      description: "We’re excited to announce that on 19 September 2023, the FAIR-EASE Consortium of 26 partners, coordinated by CNRS, is holding its second full in-person consortium meeting! We are ready to build on the work done in the first 12 months of the project. We are working on the first interdomain digital architecture for integrated use of environmental data, made of two main components: a FAIR-EASE Interdisciplinary Data Discovery and Access Service and a FAIR-EASE Earth Analytical Lab and Data Lake. Our set of three multidisciplinary Use Cases will help us by contributing to requirements and validation of our solution."

    - title: EOSC Symposium 2023
      description: "From 20-22 September 2023, the EOSC Symposium will take place in Madrid, in the context of the Spanish Presidency of the Council of the European Union. The EOSC Symposium is organised by the EOSC Future project, together with the EOSC Tripartite collaboration (the EOSC Association, the EOSC Steering Board and the European Commission).

This year’s event will be fully hybrid, facilitating broader exchanges between stakeholders from ministries, policy makers, research organisations, service providers, research infrastructures and research communities driving the development of – and engagement with – the European Open Science Cloud. In the context of the EOSC Future project, the EOSC Symposium will also be a critical platform to showcase project achievements and key exploitable results."

    - title: Open Science FAIR
      description: "OS FAIR 2023 aims to bring together and empower open science communities and services; to identify common practices related to open science; to see what are the best synergies to deliver and operate services that work for many; and to bring experiences from all around the world and learn from each other"

    - title: DTO-BioFlow - Integration of biodiversity monitoring data into the Digital Twin Ocean 
      description: "The Horizon Europe project “Integration of biodiversity monitoring data into the Digital Twin Ocean” (DTO-BioFlow) will unlock “sleeping” biodiversity data enabling the sustained flow of these and new data via primary integrators and EMODnet into the EU Digital Twin Ocean. It will create a digital replica of marine biological processes transforming new and existing data flows into evidence-based knowledge. DTO-BioFlow will transform access to data on ocean biodiversity and the human activities that impact them, by enabling the sustainable integration of biodiversity monitoring data flows into the EU DTO, enriching digital tools and services thus unlocking the societal value of these data. To fully exploit the potential of these new and existing data flows, DTO-BioFlow will develop the biodiversity component of the DTO, i.e., the digital replica of marine ecological processes, bringing together data, models and new algorithms supporting the development of policy-relevant tools and services for effective monitoring, restoration, and protection of marine biodiversity, delivering to the objectives of the EU Mission “Restore our Ocean and Waters by 2030” and the EU Biodiversity Strategy"

# VLIZ events
Outreach by the open science team helps the general public, private, and research institutions increase their understanding of data management and FAIR principles. The movement expanded to a wider audience can lead to broader adoption and wider community input in decision making.
