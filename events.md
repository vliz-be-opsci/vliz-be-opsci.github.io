    - title: FAIR-EASE Second Annual Event
      description: "We’re excited to announce that on 19 September 2023, the FAIR-EASE Consortium of 26 partners, coordinated by CNRS, is holding its second full in-person consortium meeting! We are ready to build on the work done in the first 12 months of the project. We are working on the first interdomain digital architecture for integrated use of environmental data, made of two main components: a FAIR-EASE Interdisciplinary Data Discovery and Access Service and a FAIR-EASE Earth Analytical Lab and Data Lake. Our set of three multidisciplinary Use Cases will help us by contributing to requirements and validation of our solution."

    - title: EOSC Symposium 2023
      description: "From 20-22 September 2023, the EOSC Symposium will take place in Madrid, in the context of the Spanish Presidency of the Council of the European Union. The EOSC Symposium is organised by the EOSC Future project, together with the EOSC Tripartite collaboration (the EOSC Association, the EOSC Steering Board and the European Commission).

This year’s event will be fully hybrid, facilitating broader exchanges between stakeholders from ministries, policy makers, research organisations, service providers, research infrastructures and research communities driving the development of – and engagement with – the European Open Science Cloud. In the context of the EOSC Future project, the EOSC Symposium will also be a critical platform to showcase project achievements and key exploitable results."
