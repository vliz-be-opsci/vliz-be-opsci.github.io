# Linked data @ VLIZ

Since 2020 the VLIZ Marine Data Centre, in its pursuit of FAIR and Open Data, has been gradually implementing Semantic Web Technology [techniques, libraries and frameworks](/technical-approach) to help grow the «Research Knowledge Graph». 

In this enterprise we have eagerly fallen back on our long standing data management of important existing reference systems. Essentially we are now exposing those reference systems using standard linked-data techniques.

Through these additions we provide important linkable references that can help classify, order, fragment and thus identify, cluster, compare and analyze linked concepts be they coarse and general like metadata on datasets from high up to bottom level detailed actual data-points.

With this overview we want to give a general sense of the available linked open data we help produce.

## marineinfo.org

[MarineInfo.org](https://marineinfo.org/) exposes the various entities from the VLIZ IMIS (Integrated Marine Information System) as linked-open-data.  This catalog effectively includes datasets, publications, people, institutes and projects.

More information can be found in their [service description](https://marineinfo.org/products-and-services)

## marineregions.org

The Gazetteer [MarineRegions.org](https://marineregions.org/) maintains the list of named and identified geographical regions for a practical usage in Scientific Research. These so called GeoObjects are exposed linked-open-data, including the relations between them and their geometries.

A thorough description and motivation of its development and workings can be found in [Lonneville et al.](https://marineinfo.org/id/publication/346947)

A practical description of the available uritemplates for the individual GeoObject representations as well as the [LDES fragmentation](https://marineregions.org/feed) of the full dataset can be find under their [webservices description](https://marineregions.org/gazetteer.php?p=webservices) 


## marinespecies.org (coming soon!)

The (World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS)](https://marinespecies.org/) is a taxonomic database that aims to provide an authoritative and comprehensive list of names of marine organisms.

Through the collaboration of VLIZ in the [MareGraph project](https://www.maregraph.eu/) we are preparing the Linked-Open-Data publication of this important reference.
